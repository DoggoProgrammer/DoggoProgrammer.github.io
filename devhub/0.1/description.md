## Version 0.1

Version 0.1 is a Test Version of the DevHub. It does not include the Full DevHub. Full Version will be probably released in Version 1.0.
Upcoming Test Versions Are:

| Version | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0.2 | Communication Systems Will Be Started |
| 0.3 | Communication Systems Will Be Updated And Officially Added |
| 0.4 | DevHub Will Not Be Synapse X Only |

The Player needs to have these Files under workspace:
console.lua
setup.lua
Which means that DevHub is for Synapse X Only.
This will be changed in Version 0.4.
